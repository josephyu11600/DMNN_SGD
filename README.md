# DMNN_SGD

Implementation and benchmarking of a dendrite morphological neural network for the task of seizure detection compared to other lightweight classifiers, SVMR and LDA, that are commonly used in brain machine interfaces. Also offers to our knowledge the first implementation of a DMNN using PyTorch.
